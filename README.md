Here’s a clean and well-structured `README.md` for your Shakespeare text generator using LSTM and TensorFlow:

# 📝 Shakespeare Text Generator

A deep learning project using LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) networks to generate Shakespeare-like text, trained on the works of William Shakespeare.

---

## 📚 Project Description

This project uses a character-level LSTM model trained on Shakespeare's text corpus to generate new text in the style of Shakespeare. It leverages TensorFlow and Keras for model training and prediction. The user can adjust the **temperature** parameter to control the randomness of the generated text.

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Python** 🐍
- **TensorFlow / Keras** 🤖
- **NumPy** 🔢
- **LSTM Neural Networks** 📈

---

## 📂 Dataset

- Source: [Shakespeare's works](https://storage.googleapis.com/download.tensorflow.org/data/shakespeare.txt) provided by TensorFlow.
- Preprocessing: 
  - Lowercased and sliced to use a specific portion of the text.
  - Character-level one-hot encoding.

---

## 🧠 Model Architecture

```python
model = Sequential()
model.add(LSTM(128, input_shape=(SEQ_LENGTH, len(characters))))
model.add(Dense(len(characters)))
model.add(Activation('softmax'))
```

- **Optimizer**: RMSprop
- **Loss**: Categorical Crossentropy
- **Input Sequence Length**: 40 characters

---

## 🔥 Sampling Function

A custom sampling method is used to control diversity of predictions using the `temperature` parameter. Lower values make the output more predictable; higher values add more randomness.

---

## 🚀 How to Use

1. **Clone the repository** and install required packages:

```bash
pip install tensorflow numpy
```

2. **Run the script**:

```bash
python text_generator.py
```

3. **Generated Output**:

The script prints five different outputs using increasing `temperature` values to demonstrate the model’s creativity and control:

```python
print(generate_text(300, 0.2))
print(generate_text(300, 0.4))
print(generate_text(300, 0.5))
print(generate_text(300, 0.6))
print(generate_text(300, 0.7))
print(generate_text(300, 0.8))
```

---

## 🧪 Example Output (temp = 0.5)

```
enter your lovely hand of mine that love
doth leave me not the might and mighty time,
i’ll stay the blood of such a mighty eye,
and yet my soul will live in deathly joy.
```

---

## 📦 Model

- A pre-trained model (`textgenerator_model.keras`) is loaded for text generation.
- If training is required, uncomment the preprocessing and model training sections in the script.
